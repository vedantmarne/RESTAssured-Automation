# RESTAssured-Automation

RestAssured Framework is an Open-source Java-based framework used by programmers and developers for testing and validating REST services. Built from the ground up to cater to the varying needs of testing, RestAssured Framework provides a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to create and write powerful tests for RESTful APIs efficiently.

The RestAssured framework also supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD) or Gherkin style of writing for enhanced readability and clean coding to enable seamless testing workflows. To simplify the testing tasks, REST Assured aids in easy integration of classic testing frameworks such as TestNG and JUnit runner that are used by organizations to assess their REST web services. 

### Key Features of RestAssured Framework

With RestAssured Framework, Automation Testing professionals can create customized and user-friendly HTTP requests that can be used to test RESTful Web Services. This helps in testing a variety of request combinations with respect to the business logic layer of applications. Fetching data is easy, regardless of the complexity of JSON structures, because REST Assured simplifies the validation process for users with human-readable results.

The main features of RestAssured Framework that enable it to be more resourceful follows:

* It eliminates the aspect of writing complex codes that are required to set up an HTTP connection, send or receive a request, and parse a response. 
* It makes the test results easy to read as it supports notations such as ‘given’ or ‘then’ or ‘when.’
* Integrating REST Assured into a continuous delivery setup is easy when paired with Java testing frameworks like TestNG, JUnit, etc.
* Apart from technical response data validation, REST Assured also supports data-driven API testing to allow testers to perform complex tests.  
* REST Assured serves as the main support system for XML- and JSON-path syntax for checking several elements of the response data.


### API Testing with RestAssured Framework

RestAssured Framework helps assess and identify errors found during the process of application development. In order to use RestAssured Framework for API Automation Testing, knowledge of suitable IDE (IntelliJ or Eclipse), Maven, frameworks such as TestNG, or JUnit is necessary. The two ways used for testing Rest APIs are Manual Testing and Automation Testing. The most commonly used method is Automation testing for REST APIs as it helps interpret results effectively.

Rest API uses five HTTP methods for requesting commands as listed below:

GET: Retrieves information from a specific URL. <br>
PUT: Updates previous resources or creates new information at the specified URL. <br>
PATCH: Partial updates. <br>
POST: Develops a new entity and is also used to send information to the server for uploading files or information. <br>
DELETE: Deletes the present representation at a particular URL. <br>


* Request & Response Specifications
* Setting up a Base Class for API testing defaults
* Measuring Response time in REST Assured
* Covers all HTTP Verbs (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE) - for both JSON and XML
* Advanced assertions
* Testing and validating against both XML and JSON Schemas
